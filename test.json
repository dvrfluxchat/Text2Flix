SPARKLE had bright blue hair that shimmered in the sunlight, and he wore a tiny purple hat on his head. He loved to play tricks on his friends and make them laugh [laughs]. One day, while wandering through the forest, SPARKLE stumbled upon a SECRET path that led to a HIDDEN treasure. His eyes widened with excitement as he saw the glimmering gold coins and sparkling jewels. 'Oh, what a GRAND discovery!' SPARKLE exclaimed, and he quickly gathered the treasure into a little bag.

'Greetings, young SPARKLE,' said the genie, 'You have found the treasure of WISHES. What is your deepest desire?' SPARKLE thought for a moment, his eyes gleaming with excitement. 'I wish for everyone in the world to be HAPPY!' he exclaimed. The genie smiled and granted his wish with a wave of his hand. Instantly, laughter filled the air, and people everywhere began to SMILE. SPARKLE's heart swelled with joy [laughs]. But little did he know, there was another adventure waiting for him."
